Birds of a feather flock together 
Out of the frying pan into the fire 
Sweet talk 
A rags to riches story 
Let's get to the point 
Worry wart 
To teach a fish how to swim 
You don't know what you've got until you've lost it 
A rolling stone gathers no moss 
Necessity is the mother of invention 
Pie in the sky 
Let sleeping dogs lie 
A loaf of bread is better than the song of many birds 
Icing on the cake 
Don't count your chickens before they hatch 
Born in a barn 
The grass is greener on the other side of the fence 
Walls have ears 
It's a piece of cake 
Cut off your nose to spite your face 
The cat that ate the canary 
Thorn in the side 
A rat in a trap 
Look before you leap 
As the twig is bent, so grows the trees 
Casting pearls before swine 
It takes two to tango 
The pot calls the kettle black 
Where there is a will, there is a way 
The end justifies the means 
Ignorance is bliss 
Sour grapes 
No news is good news 
One rotten apple spoils the barrel 
Stabbed in the back 
He that will steal a pin will steal an ox 
One picture is worth a thousand words 
Many hands make light work 
Can't get blood from a turnip 
After the storm comes the calm 
The worst wheel of the cart always creaks most 
Too many cooks spoil the broth 
Turning green with envy 
The sparrow near a school sings the primer 
A little knowledge is dangerous 
What's learned in the cradle is carried to the grave 
Time heals all wounds 
Mend the barn after the horse is stolen 
He bit off more than he can chew 
Talking to the wall 
Strike while the iron is hot 
Well begun, half done 
Love me, love my dog 
Where there's smoke, there's fire 
Life is full of ups and downs 
It's no use crying over spilt milk 
Adding insult to injury 
Clothes make the man 
Stars off with a bang and ends with a whimper 
The squeaky wheel gets the grease 
Face the music 
Even Homer nods 
To have the right chemistry 
Fight fire with fire 
Every minute seems like s thousand 
Kill two birds with one stone 
A good medicine tastes bitter 
Once bitten, twice shy 
He got what he bargained for 
Searching for a needle in a haystack 
One man sows and another man reaps 
Every cloud has a silver lining 
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder 
Go home and kick the dog 
A buddy from my old stomping grounds 
Finders keepers, loser weepers 
Every dog has his day 
Even a worm will turn 
Between a rock and a hard place 
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step 
Match made in heaven 
Rome wasn't built in a day 
You've cried wolf too many times 
Everyone has a skeleton in his closet 
Little drops of water make the mighty ocean 
Charity begins at home 
You could sell him the Brooklyn Bridge 
Blood is thicker than water 
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread 
In one ear and out the other 
Thrown away like an old shoe 
Every Jack has his Jill 
Running around like a chicken with its head cut off 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained 
Speak of the devil 
A stitch in time saves nine
